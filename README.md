# Würfelbrett

The primary idea behind Würfelbrett (engl. dice board) is to support remote play of pen and paper roleplay games. The long term vision is to have a "chat room" or a lobby, where everyone attending is able to roll dice if needed. The result is displayed publicly in that lobby for every participant to see. In the player control area, the player creates a digital dice cup with a requested set of dice to roll.

This project is created because of the following reasons:

- Become a better developer through out continuous practice.
- Learn React. I don't have any experience with the React library. 
- Learn TypeScript. I only have little experience with JavaScript.
- To support my friends who are playing pen and paper games with a small little helper for their/our sessions.
- How to proper maintain a repository.

**Attention**: This tool is in a very very veeeery early stage of development. At this moment in this repository, there is just this simple client application. There is so much to do, please bear with me. Improvements are coming.

## How to setup and run the project locally
 
To run the project locally, Node.js with a package manager of your choice (i.e. npm or yarn) is required. For instructions how to install Node.js for your OS, please refer to the official documentation at [Node.js Homepage](https://nodejs.org).

### Run the project locally

The following part is a copy paste from the README.md created by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) after creating a fresh app. The following quick guide uses the package manager yarn. npm will work in a similar manner.

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
