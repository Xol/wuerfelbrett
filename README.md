# Würfelbrett (engl. dice board)

The primary idea behind Würfelbrett is to support remote play of pen and paper roleplaying games. The long term vision is to have a "chat room" or a lobby, where everyone attending is able to roll dice if needed. The result is displayed in public in that lobby for every participant to see. In the player control area, the player creates a digital dice cup with a requested set of dice to roll.

This project is created because of the following reasons:

- Become a better developer through out continuous practice.
- Learn React. I don't have any experience with the React library. 
- Learn TypeScript. I only have little experience with JavaScript.
- To support my friends who are playing pen and paper games with a small little helper for their/our sessions.
- How to proper maintain a repository.

**Attention**: This tool is in a very very veeeery early stage of development. At this moment, there is just this simple client application you can find in this repository. There is so much to do, please bear with me. Improvements are coming.
